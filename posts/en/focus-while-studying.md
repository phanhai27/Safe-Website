title: Clean environment to focus on studying
description: When online, a lot of interesting and attractive things will make children lose focus. Create a whitelist of only websites and apps dedicated to learning.
summary: Electronic devices such as computers, tablets or smartphones are useful tools to help students learn online at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, young people are easily distracted by the attractiveness of these devices. In particular, owning too many electronic devices within reach can reduce children's learning and working performance.

A study by the University of Chicago (USA) shows that smartphones can significantly reduce people's ability to concentrate, even when you are not using them. Students who were asked to keep their phones in another room scored higher on tests than students who kept their phones in their desk drawers or in their pockets.

Technological devices are designed to be user-friendly, even addictive. Notifications of applications and software are always pushed to the screen continuously to attract the attention of users.

When you try to focus on more than one task, your productivity can drop by 40%. Therefore, this distraction can negatively impact the learning outcomes of students, especially when studying online at home.
