This generation of parents is raising children in a cyber world that is continually evolving. Children learn and adapt rapidly by nature, but much more so in our technological era. In addition to the countless tasks that come with parenting, parents now have the added responsibility of monitoring their children's Internet use and leading them securely across the digital frontier.

## Keeping Your Children Safe Online: Cybersecurity Tips for Parents

Thankfully, there are a few basic cybersecurity tips that every parent should know to make sure their children stay safe while browsing the web. 
Here are a few tips worth mentioning:

### Monitor your child's daily activities
It’s also important to monitor your children’s online activity in order to ensure they are staying safe while surfing the web. Establishing rules for online activity helps set boundaries and encourages responsible behavior when your kids are using the internet. Some of these rules may include supervising all online activities, setting time limits, and only allowing access to sites that are age appropriate. 
You can do this by installing parental control software or using monitoring services offered by many internet service providers (ISPs).  Additionally, ensure you talk with your children about internet safety, such as not responding to suspicious emails or giving out any personal information online without permission.  

### Password reset
As you are aware, occasionally, databases are not adequately safeguarded and can be hacked. Regularly changing passwords often is the most effective solution to this issue. Remind your children that they should change their passwords at least once every three months. Make it seem like a fun game to entice your children to change their passwords, even if they do so more for amusement than for security.

### Report cyber bullying
Before sending children back to school, a brief reminder of the danger of cyberbullying is required. Remind them how to identify and report the issue. Cyberbullying may be harmful to children of all ages. You should ensure they keep their distance from strangers and inform you if anything out of the ordinary occurs with friends. You may also conduct parental control using a variety of techniques. And if you see anything alarming, take them away from the hazardous information or friendship in a gentle manner. You want your children's trust!

### Be mindful of your belongings
Emphasize that electronics may be tampered with and that youngsters should not leave them alone. Children must always keep their electronic gadgets secured. Tell them you will not replace their items if they do not take care of them. If they fail to take care of their phone or tablet, have them visualize how lengthy and tiring the months will be without one. It's important to talk with your kids about how they can keep their devices safe. 

### Keeping passwords secure
Tell your children to always be careful while using passwords at school or college. Inform them that their password might be stolen via shoulder-peeping. Give them an example and encourage them to consider how they would feel if someone began posting garbage from their social media page because he or she knew their password. Ensure that no one is monitoring them while they input a password. Inform them not to reveal their passwords to anybody. Moreover, install a **[trusted VPN](https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/)** service on their device to be used while traveling or when using public Wi-Fi networks to prevent hackers from accessing vital information.

### Click carefully
Whether subtle or brazen, **[phishing](https://www.orienteed.com/en/phishing-identify-protect-yourself)** is a harmful practice. One accidental click is required for malicious software to infiltrate devices and cause havoc. Discuss with your children the importance of not clicking on email links carelessly. Show them how to hover over the link to verify that it leads to a credible website. Some of the obvious symptoms of a phishing email aimed at installing malware on your device include misspellings, unusual emails from well-known firms, and urgent demands for immediate action. When in doubt, avoid clicking links. Instead, visit the company's website and contact the individual in question or customer care to confirm that you received the email. Thankfully, most high-quality antivirus software, such as Norton Security, will intercept these fraudulent emails before they reach you.

### Set Up Parental Controls 
Most devices come with built-in parental controls that allow you to monitor and restrict your children’s online activity. Take advantage of these tools, as they help you ensure your kids only access age-appropriate content and websites. You may also have the ability to set time restrictions on devices so that they are not used excessively or during certain hours of the day. Make sure to explore all of the capabilities available to make the most of these features. **[SafeWeb](https://safeweb.app/en/)** provides a focused working environment by blocking social networking sites and game apps while learning or working. It also shows time-wasting behaviors with a graph of usage time of applications and time spent on websites featured in the dashboard. It even has real-time reporting capabilities so that if there is any policy violation, an email warning will be sent out to alert the parent immediately. Be sure to **[integrate SafeWeb.app into your family's cybersecurity plan](https://safeweb.app/en/download/)** for peace of mind.

## Conclusion:  
Keeping our kids safe while they explore the digital world requires a combination of education, monitoring tools, and open communication between parents and children alike. As technology continues to evolve, so too does cybercrime. That's why it's so important for parents to stay informed about basic cybersecurity measures to protect their children from potential threats online. 
By following these simple steps, parents can arm their kids with the knowledge they need to stay safe while using technology — and have peace of mind knowing their child’s cybersecurity is in good hands!
